    <p>
      A <strong>croissant</strong> is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie
      pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French
      yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical
      crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry.
